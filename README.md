## Advent of Code

This repository contains results for some of 2021 and the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Most of this code is in rough prototype form and in the form I used to calculate the answers.  I have not cleaned up the
code and much of it could use refactoring and better practices.
